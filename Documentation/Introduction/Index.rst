The extension allows you to build object data into your TYPO3 project. Objects
can be connected to object groups and attached to locations. The extension is
part of the Cultural Heritage Framework (CHF), which provides additional
functionality such as events, agents, and various additional data models.

    The extension is not final yet. A lot of things may still change over the
    coming months.
