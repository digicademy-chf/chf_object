  The extension provides a data model for object-centric
  data, as part of the Cultural Heritage Framework (CHF).
  This may be used to extend image archives or to compile
  object-specific data in its own right. A central
  resource of this data model may contain, among others,
  locations (e.g., buildings), object groups (e.g., parts
  of a building), and objects themselves. Each of these
  may be annotated individually. Locations may further be
  equipped with floor plans while objects may specify
  representations as well as schematics to illustrate, for
  example, which parts of an object have been restored.
