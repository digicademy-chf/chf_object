==========
CHF Object
==========

The extension provides a data model for object-centric data, as part of the
Cultural Heritage Framework (CHF). This may be used to extend image archives
or to compile object-specific data in its own right. A central resource of
this data model may contain, among others, locations (e.g., buildings),
object groups (e.g., parts of a building), and objects themselves. Each of
these may be annotated individually. Locations may further be equipped with
floor plans while objects may specify representations as well as schematics
to illustrate, for example, which parts of an object have been restored.
